This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans), Shenzhen, China. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Southwest University](https://www.swu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China. My research interests include Multimodal Large Language Models, Computer Vision, and Autonomous Driving. I have published some papers in the NeurIPS 2025, ACM Multimedia (ACM MM 2024) (Oral, only 3.97%), ACM Multimedia (ACM MM 2025), IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025), IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (T-IV), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (T-CSVT), IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (T-GRS), IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence (T-ETCI), IEEE Sensors Journal (I-SJ) and Journal of Cleaner Production (J-CP). Besides, I also serve as a reviewer in some excellent conferences and journals, including AAAI, ACM MM, IEEE T-ASE, etc. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, you can contact me via email: hanfujun@cuhk.edu.cn.
