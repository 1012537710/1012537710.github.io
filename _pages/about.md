I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans), China. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Southwest University](https://www.swu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China. My research interests include **Multimodal Large Language Models**, **Computer Vision**, and **Autonomous Driving**. I have published some papers in the NeurIPS 2025, ACM Multimedia (ACM MM 2024) (Oral, only 3.97%), ACM Multimedia (ACM MM 2025), IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025), IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (T-ASE), IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (T-IV), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (T-CSVT), IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (T-GRS), IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence (T-ETCI), IEEE Sensors Journal (I-SJ) and Journal of Cleaner Production (J-CP). Besides, I also serve as a reviewer in some excellent conferences and journals, including AAAI, ACM MM, IEEE T-ASE, etc. If you are interested in my research or have any questions, you can contact me via email: **hanfujun@cuhk.edu.cn**.
